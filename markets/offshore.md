<p class="lead"><strong>Offshore Winds</strong>, modeling from farms to power plants No matter: offshore measurements are priceless. Treat online the resource and secure your offshore project development through Vortex air and sea modelling pivots.</p>

##For initial project proposal and offshore zones tenders to final decision making

**Quantify the resource for any maritime domain with a verified modeling chain.**

MAP, MAST, FARM and SERIES extended offshore domains provide a complete analysis of the resource. Gain all the flexibility to redefine the perfect layout from detailed information's on wind profiles, turbulence, extremes, long-term variability and drag effect of wind farm clusters.

##When terrain is all rough sea

**How many winter days the windfarm is likely to be inaccessible? Need design precise specifications on waves topology?**

Contact us for our METOCEAN products built on the latest advances in high resolution wave and atmospheric coupled modeling. Retrieve all the marine conditions affecting project design and O&M through a reliable characterization of joint wind&wave distributions, significant wave heights and peak spectral period.
