Downscaling of ERA5 reanalysis has been implemented into the whole Vortex modeling chain and has passed demanding internal tests that shown, among other results, an impressive R2=1.00 correlation coefficient reached for the very first time in our records!

It is not only correlation that has dramatically increased, mean wind speed BIAS has also greatly decreased, prompting us to implement ERA5 in all products (MAPS, FARM, LES, etc.) in what can be considered the most important system upgrade since Vortex was founded.

The characteristics of ERA5 and its Vortex implementation & validation will be extensively presented next Tuesday 28-November during WindEurope exhibition (room D403, Elicium -4th floor-). For that event, we are very pleased to count on the collaboration of Hans Hersbach, C3S Reanalysis Team Leader at ECMWF.

Event’s agenda

- Presentation by Pep Moreno (Vortex). 5'
- ERA5 Introduction by Hans Hersbach (ECWMF). 15’
- ERA5 Validation by Abel Tortosa (Vortex). 15'
- ERA5 Consistency by Gil Lizcano (Vortex). 15'
- Q&A

See you in Amsterdam soon!






#  Give me 5, ERA!

ECMWFs newest Reanalysis, ERA5, is already here! And, by "here" we mean that we have embedded it into the whole Vortex modeling chain and that will be available from our Interface by the end of this month.

You may think that introducing a new Reanalysis is only a small step but, with ERA5, it means a giant leap in accuracy improvement according to several internal tests that will be presented during next WindEurope event.

This improvement is so important that we have decided not only to implement ERA5 in our SERIES product (as was the case with MERRA2) but also to make it available to the rest of the portfolio in what can be considerer the most system upgrade since Vortex was founded.

Please, stay posted. More information coming soon!
