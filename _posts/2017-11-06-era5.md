#  Give me 5, ERA!

ECMWFs newest Reanalysis, ERA5, is already here! And, by "here" we mean that we have embedded it into the whole Vortex modeling chain and that will be available from our Interface by the end of this month.

You may think that introducing a new Reanalysis is only a small step but, with ERA5, it means a giant leap in accuracy improvement according to several internal tests that will be presented during next WindEurope event.

This improvement is so important that we have decided not only to implement ERA5 in our SERIES product (as was the case with MERRA2) but also to make it available to the rest of the portfolio in what can be considerer the most system upgrade since Vortex was founded.

Please, stay posted. More information coming soon!
