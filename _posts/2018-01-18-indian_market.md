# Vortex promises to grow in the Indian market this 2018

In Vortex, we are leading experts in the wind modeling, and had an incredible 2017, we implemented the first stream of  ECMWF Copernicus ERA5 reanalysis in our computing cluster and now we are providing all our wind&site products  driven by this promising new effort in Renalysis technology.  

Vortex also has played a key role in the development of the recently launched Global Wind Atlas 2.0 (GWA 2.0). The GWA is a web-based platform to explore wind resources through an interactive mapping and data tools. GWA was the product of a partnership between the World Bank and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) to help policymakers and investors identify promising areas for wind power generation.

Our team will visit India next week, as it is very important for us to encourage the development of wind projects in countries with great wind potential, such as India. Tulsi Tanti, the newly appointed chairman of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association (IWTMA), expects India to surpass its 60-GW wind capacity target “much before” 2022. This is one of the reasons why for us is very important to know the main needs of the Indian market.

For the third consecutive year Vortex continues working with India's National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), to enhance wind forecasting in Tamil Nadu state. We and NIWE will provide electricity generation forecasts down to a fifteen-minute resolution up to 10 days ahead.

We started our technology development in 2007 with a team of wind industry professionals with extensive experience. This 2018 promises a lot for our company, which is in expansion and as commented Pep Moreno, CEO of Vortex,  we are ready to continue supporting the development of wind projects through the provision of increasingly accurate wind data.
