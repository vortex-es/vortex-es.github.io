Vortex has validated the studies done in 70 points of India with real life results. At Vortex we are committed to provide prospects every day with an increasingly lower margin of error.

In India we have worked hand in hand with India National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) to enhance wind forecasting in Tamil Nadu state. 

We have done this for 3 consecutive years, which has given us a great experience in the Indian market, which combined with our low margin of error, makes us the best ally for your wind project in Asia.
