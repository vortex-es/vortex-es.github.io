# Should I send you my local measurements to calibrate your model?

No, your measured data is your only reference to check the reliability of our modeling system. If you have good-quality, local measurements, comparing them against our short-term (1 year) product, MAST, gives you a clean measure of the model’s ability to reproduce your particular case. To be clean, such comparison is performed at your office: you never send your measured data, its us who send you our computer results.

Since the methodology used to compute all other, long-term Vortex wind estimations is the same as that used for MAST, you can use the accuracy of the results of the latter to estimates the accuracy of the former.
