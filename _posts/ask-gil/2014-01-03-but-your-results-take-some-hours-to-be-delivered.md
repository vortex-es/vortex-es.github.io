#But your results take some hours to be delivered...

Yes, this is due to the fact that calculations are non-linear, and non-linear computing is not immediate. Pre-calculating the whole world at high resolution using a non-linear model would require a huge amount of computing power and would also result in thousands of non-interesting areas being calculated.

As a beneficial side effect, running each simulation on-demand allows Vortex to incorporate cutting edge technology or lessons from former cas through an on-going learning process.
