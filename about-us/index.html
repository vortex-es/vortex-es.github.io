				<h2>Experienced</h2>

				<p><strong>Vortex</strong> started its technology development in 2007 by former Wind&Site engineers (with more than 20 years of experience), atmospheric physicists and computer experts in a unusual collaborative team of experienced professionals with active researchers.</p>
